MineRogue Fortress - An Ambitious Project in Pygame

This project derives from 3 games I'm enamored with(and some others):

- Minecraft
- Rogue
- Dwarf Fortress

Granted, I haven't played much of Rogue(or NetHack, or even Pokemon Mystery Dungeon), and this game is likely to also feature pinches of Don't Starve, Pikmin and the Oddworld series, too. Namely, pretty much every game I loved.

It's a game about setting camp in an unforgiving world. A game about changing the environment and adapting to it as well as adapting it to yourself. A game about managing resources and discovering ways of using them the best way possible.

And it's also a game about space moles. ;D

And yes, it's going to be done in Pygame. Because I love python, and am not really interested in learning any other new engine right now.
